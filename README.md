DISCLAIMER:
This is just one way of making the game. I've based this version mostly off of how
crazy eights was designed. We could have many slight differences if another person
coded their own version of the game. For example Daniel Keinan pointed out to me that
we could instead just have an array instead of a first and top card.

RULES

1. The gameplay area starts with four foundation piles arranged on each side.
2. In addition, there are four corner piles that start empty.
  - There can only be built upo by placing a king in that pile first
  - Hence: "Kings Corners'
3. The goal is to be the first player to empty your hand.
4. Cards can be removed/moved onto any other card in a solitaire-like pattern:
  - Descending by rank, alternation colors
  - e.g., Jack of Diamonds can be played on Queen of Spades
5. During a turn, a player can take four actions:
  - Play a correct card from their hand onto any non-empty pile
  - Play any card onto an empty foudation pile
  - Move a full pile onto another pile(must maintain the solitaire pattern)
  - Play a King onto an empty corner pile
6. A player takes as many actions as they can on their turn
7. They end their turn by drawing a card from the top of the draw deck.
